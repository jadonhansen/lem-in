Read in lem-in output

Allocate info into a struct (GNL)
use struct to create SDL_Rect rooms with art assets (perhaps rects not needed)
Link them together (middle of room, will need to do some math for this)
Try place rooms on canvas with the image ref point being (img w / 2) to the left
and (img h / 2) upwards of the room coord, so that the middle of the image is the room coordinate?

Animation loop for ants moving between rooms. Figure out how to move the ants in a linear direction
(middle of room to middle of room)





(Have spacebar advance each turn)
(Rewrite switch and case statements to be norm friendly)
